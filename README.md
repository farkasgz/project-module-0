# BrickBreaker

## Description
BrickBreaker is a fun, lighthearted browser game, where the goal is to destroy as many bricks as you can and achieve the highest possible score. You control a black "racket" that you can use to bouce a ball around. If the ball hits a brick, it will destroy it, increasing your score. If the ball passes the your racket, you lose a life. After losing 3 lives, the game is over.
